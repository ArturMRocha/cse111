Project: Master Batch File Renamer and Organizer

This report details the time and work invested in developing a Python application to rename and organize files in a user's file system. The project evolved from a simple batch renamer to a more robust tool that also categorizes files into type-specific subdirectories.

description of the work that you did on your project.

      Time Spent

----------  ----------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
2025-08-04      2.0     Researched initial project scope. Explored Python libraries for
                        file system interaction, comparing `os.path` with the modern
                        `pathlib`. Decided to use `pathlib` for its object-oriented
                        approach. Sketched a basic program flow diagram on paper.

2025-08-05      2.5     Wrote the initial core functions: `find_files_in_directory` to
                        list files and `execute_rename_operation` with basic `os.rename`.
                        Implemented the main user interface loop in the `main` function
                        to get user input for the target directory.

2025-08-06      2.5     Developed the batch renaming logic in `build_batch_rename_map`.
                        Researched how to implement zero-padding for sequential numbers
                        and learned to use `math.log10` to dynamically calculate the
                        necessary padding based on the number of files. Debugged an
                        edge case where the log function would fail with 1 file.

2025-08-07      1.5     Improved the user interaction flow. Added logic to search for
                        folders recursively from the home directory if a full path isn't
                        provided. Implemented the choice menu for when multiple folders
                        with the same name are found. Added better error handling for
                        user input.

2025-08-08      2.0     Researched automated testing for file operations. Watched videos
                        on the `pytest` framework and learned about the `tmp_path` fixture,
                        which is essential for testing file system changes without
                        affecting real files. Wrote the first two test functions for
                        `find_files_in_directory` and `build_batch_rename_map`.

2025-08-11      2.5     Discussed project expansion with a tutor. Decided to add the
                        "organizer" feature. Designed the `organize_files_by_type`
                        function, creating a dictionary to map extensions to folder
                        names. Researched `shutil.move` as a more robust alternative
                        to `os.rename` for moving files between directories. Wrote and
                        integrated the new function into the main workflow.

2025-08-13      1.5     Wrote a new test function `test_organize_files_by_type` to
                        validate the new organizer logic. Performed final code cleanup,
                        added detailed docstrings to all functions, and verified all
                        parts of the project were working together seamlessly. Prepared
                        final files for submission and wrote this report.
