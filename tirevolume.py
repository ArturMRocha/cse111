# --- Enhancement Description ---
# This program exceeds the requirements by asking the user if they would like to
# buy tires with the entered dimensions. If the user answers "yes", the program
# then asks for their phone number and appends it to the entry in the volumes.txt log file.
# This provides a simple way to collect sales leads.
